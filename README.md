# Hello!
my todo.rb is a todo list creator essentially.. it can open any ruby friendly file but i recommend only dealing with files already created by it else it will replace the file contents. Toggles are per session only they are reset upon restarting the program.

To run:
-----------
You need Ruby available at https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
You need your favorite command line tool 
  * http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/
  * comes with Mac OS

CD to the .rb file and run!
